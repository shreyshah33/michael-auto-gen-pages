[index.html](https://github.com/shreyshah33/michael-auto-gen-pages/blob/main/index.html) is the main template page that gets the data replaced in it based on the query.

[data.js](https://github.com/shreyshah33/michael-auto-gen-pages/blob/main/data.js) is where you'll store the data. I could've used json but this felt easier to understand.

[app.js](https://github.com/shreyshah33/michael-auto-gen-pages/blob/main/app.js) is where the magic happens.
